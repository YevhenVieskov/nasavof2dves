1) Do not use -fast optimization with pgf90 

2) For the data set obstacle.par, and for the pgf90
   compiler, the simulation fails at t=19.+ whenever
   particle tracing is turned on. This corresponds to
   the time when the first particles injected would be
   exiting at the downstream boundary. The simulation
   terminates normally when compiled with f90 on
   SGI machines.
